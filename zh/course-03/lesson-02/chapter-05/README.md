# Chapter 5: Summary

Congratulations, you have successfully completed the interaction between the front-end  and the smart contract, and now users can play TicTacToe entirely on Bitcoin!

You can continue to improve this dApp, for example:

- Build a back-end for it to support multiple pair of players
- Move the UTXO management from front-end, as it is now, to back-end
- Support more wallets
- Increase the board size, such as 5 X 5

The code of this course is at: [Bitcoin onchain App Tutorial](https://github.com/sCrypt-Inc/tic-tac-toe).

Look forward to the killer dApp you build on Bitcoin.
