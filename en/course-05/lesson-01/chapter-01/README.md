# Chapter 1: Course overview

In this course, you will learn how to build a full-stack voting decentralized application (dApp) on the Bitcoin blockchain using sCrypt. This will include learning how to create a smart contract for voting and build an interactive front-end to enable users to cast votes on a candidate list.

We will build in the following steps:

1. Writing the smart contract
2. Creating a React App
3. Integrating the wallet and sCrypt service
4. Building the front-end

## How it works

You can take a look at what the finished app will look like [here](https://classic.scrypt.io/voting/).
